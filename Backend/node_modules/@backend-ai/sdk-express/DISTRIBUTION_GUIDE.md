## 🚀 Recommended Sharing Approach

### Step 1: Initial Contact
Send developers the **QUICKSTART.md** with this message:

```
Hi [Name],

To integrate your Express backend with Backend AI, we've created an NPM package 
that makes it super easy - just 3 lines of code!

Here's the quick start guide: [attach QUICKSTART.md]

Prerequisites:
- Express.js backend (v4+)
- Gemini API key (get one here: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

You'll also need these from us:
- Tenant ID: [provide tenant ID]
- Core URL: [provide Core service URL]

Let me know if you have any questions!
```

### Step 2: Follow-up
Once they've tried the quick start, share **INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**:

```
Great! Now for production deployment, here's the complete integration guide 
that covers security, testing, and best practices: [attach INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md]
```

### Step 3: Technical Deep-Dive (if needed)
If they want to understand the internals, share **README.md**.

---

## 📋 What Developers Need From You

Before they can integrate, provide:

1. **Tenant ID** - Their unique tenant identifier
2. **Core Service URL** - Where the Backend AI Core is hosted (e.g., `backend-ai-core.yourcompany.com:50051`)
3. **Gemini API Key** - They need their own, or you can provide one
4. **Executor Port** - Confirm which port they should use (default: 6000)

---

## 🔧 Installation Package

The SDK can be distributed in two ways:

### Option A: NPM Package (Recommended for production)

```bash
npm install @backend-ai/sdk-express
```

**Status:** Ready to publish (need to run `npm publish`)

### Option B: Git Repository (Recommended for early testing)

```bash
npm install git+https://github.com/your-org/backend-ai.git#packages/sdk-express
```

**Status:** Ready (just push to Git)

### Option C: Local Install (For testing only)

```bash
cd /path/to/Backend_AI/packages/sdk-express
npm link

# Then in their project
npm link @backend-ai/sdk-express
```

## ✅ Pre-Distribution Checklist

Before sharing with developers:

- [ ] Update `tenantId` placeholder in examples
- [ ] Update `coreUrl` with your actual Core service URL
- [ ] Test the example app works
- [ ] Verify Gemini API key requirement is clear
- [ ] Confirm executor port (6000) is accessible from Core
- [ ] Decide on distribution method (npm vs git)
- [ ] Prepare support channel (email, Slack, etc.)

## 🎯 Expected Integration Time

| Developer Experience | Time to Integrate |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Experienced with Express | **5-10 minutes** |
| Junior developer | **20-30 minutes** |
| First time with Express | **1 hour** |

Most time is spent on:
1. Getting Gemini API key
2. Configuring environment variables
3. Testing the integration

## 🐛 Common Developer Questions

**Q: Does this change my existing APIs?**  
A: No! Your APIs work exactly as before. SDK just discovers and registers them.

**Q: Do I need to modify my route handlers?**  
A: No modifications needed. SDK works with your existing code.

**Q: What about authentication?**  
A: Your auth middleware continues working for HTTP requests. Tool execution bypasses middleware (runs handlers directly).

**Q: Can I use this with TypeScript?**  
A: Yes! The SDK includes TypeScript definitions.

**Q: What if I don't have a Gemini API key?**  
A: SDK will still work but will use generic tool names like "POST /orders" instead of "Create Order".

**Q: Is this production-ready?**  
A: Yes, but ensure:
   - Executor port (6000) is not publicly accessible
   - Core service has proper network security
   - You've tested your integration
